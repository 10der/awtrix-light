AWL meant to be a companion for your smarthome like HomeAssistant, IOBroker, FHEM, NodeRed and so on.    
Even if you don't have a Smarthome system, but would like to experiment with NodeRed or N8N, you are still welcome to join us.  
Our discord community, with over 2100 people, are willing to help you!  

It is ready to use straight out of the box, with time, date, temperature, and humidity pages pre-installed. You don't need to do anything other than turning it on to start using these features.

Just send all your customapps from your smarthome via MQTT or HTTP and update it in realtime.
The powerful icon system brings your ideas to life and lets you enjoy a hassle-free experience.

# Support  
If you want to support my work, I really appreciate your donation!
All the money will be allocated towards purchasing new hardware for testing purposes, software licenses, server costs, and a significant portion will also be set aside for dinners and trips with my wife and kids so that they can continue to endure the many hours I spend programming :)
