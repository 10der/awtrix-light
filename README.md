AWTRIX Light is an openâ€‘source custom firmware for the [Ulanzi Smart Pixel clock TC001](https://www.ulanzi.com/products/ulanzi-pixel-smart-clock-2882).

It is ready to use straight out of the box, with time, date, temperature, and humidity pages pre-installed. You don't need to do anything other than turning it on to start using these features.    

However, for those with more advanced skills, the customization options available with custom pages allows you to take Awtrix Light to its full potential.
Just send all your custompages from your smarthome via MQTT. The powerful icon system bring your ideas to life and enjoy a hassle-free experience   

Join the thousands of satisfied awtrix users who have already chosen Awtrix 2 and Awtrix Light and experience the difference today!
