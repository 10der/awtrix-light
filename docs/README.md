AWTRIX 3 is a custom firmware for the [Ulanzi Smart Pixel clock](https://www.ulanzi.com/products/ulanzi-pixel-smart-clock-2882?ref=28e02dxl) (Ref link). 
It meant to be a companion for your smarthome like HomeAssistant, IOBroker, NodeRed and so on.    
Even if you don't have a Smarthome system, but would like to experiment, you are still welcome to join us. There are many users who are willing to help you!  
   
It is ready to use straight out of the box, with time, date, temperature, and humidity apps pre-installed. You don't need to do anything other than turning it on to start using these features.    

During the development of AWTRIX 3, usability and simplicity are my top priorities. My aim is to make it easy for non-tech-savvy users to benefit from AWTRIX 3 without any headaches or hours of scripting.  
AWTRIX 3 is ready to use straight out of the box, without the need for a single line of code.  
However, for those with more advanced skills, the customization options available with custom apps allow you to take AWTRIX 3 to its full potential.  
With AWTRIX 3, you can effortlessly bring your ideas to life and enjoy a hassle-free experience. 
Join the thousands of satisfied awtrix users who have already chosen Awtrix 2 and AWTRIX 3 and experience the difference today!
