Awtrix Light is a custom firmware for the [Ulanzi Smart Pixel clock](https://www.ulanzi.com/products/ulanzi-pixel-smart-clock-2882). 
It meant to be a companion for your smarthome like HomeAssistant, IOBroker, NodeRed and so on.    
Even if you don't have a Smarthome system, but would like to experiment, you are still welcome to join us. There are many users who are willing to help you!  
   
It is ready to use straight out of the box, with time, date, temperature, and humidity apps pre-installed. You don't need to do anything other than turning it on to start using these features.    

During the development of Awtrix Light, usability and simplicity are my top priorities. My aim is to make it easy for non-tech-savvy users to benefit from Awtrix Light without any headaches or hours of scripting.  
Awtrix Light is ready to use straight out of the box, without the need for a single line of code.  
However, for those with more advanced skills, the customization options available with custom apps allow you to take Awtrix Light to its full potential.  
With Awtrix Light, you can effortlessly bring your ideas to life and enjoy a hassle-free experience. 
Join the thousands of satisfied awtrix users who have already chosen Awtrix 2 and Awtrix Light and experience the difference today!
