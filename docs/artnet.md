# Artnet
  
Awtrix light supports Artnet out of the box.  
For [Jinx!](http://www.live-leds.de/) you can <a href="awtrix_light.jnx" download>download this template</a>. Just change the IP of both universes to your awtrix IP and youre ready to go.

**For any Other Arnet controller:**    
Create 2 universes with 384 channels each. Also add a new matrix layout with 8 strings รก 32 Strands and top left starting position. When you start to send data, AWTRIX will stop its normal operation and shows your data. 1s after you stop sending data, AWTRIX will return to normal operation.
