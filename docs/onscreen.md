Navigate through the items with the left and right buttons.

### Menu items

#### BRIGHT
The brightness menu allows you to adjust the brightness of the AWTRIX Light display. By default, the brightness is set to auto, which means that it is adjusted based on the ambient lighting.

To switch to manual operation, press the middle button while in the brightness menu. In manual mode, you can increase or decrease the brightness by pressing the left or right button.

To save your brightness setting, hold the middle button again for 2 seconds. This will exit the brightness menu and store your current brightness level.

#### COLOR
In this menu, you can change the color of the text. There are currently 13 different colors to choose from, so there should be something for everyone. To help you select the right color, the hex value of each color is displayed.

To change the color, use the left and right buttons to navigate through the available options. When you have found the color you want, press and hold the middle button for 2 seconds to save your setting. This will exit the menu and store your selected color.
