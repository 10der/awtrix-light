# Sounds


Optionally, you can play a sound via the integrated buzzer.  
To do this, go to the file manager in the web interface and create a new text file in the "MELODIES" folder.
Name it whatever you like but use ".txt" extension, e.g. "alarm.txt". Inside the file, place a melody in RTTTL format.
When using the sound file anywhere, omit file extension.

You can find many melodies on the internet.
